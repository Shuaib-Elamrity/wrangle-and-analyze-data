[report about project]()

## Project Overview 

### Introduction 
   Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and unifying messy and 
complex data sets for easy access and analysis. .
   
   Using Python and its libraries, I will gather data from a variety of 
sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then 
clean it. This is called data wrangling. I will document your wrangling efforts 
in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and 
visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL

### The Software Used 

- You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. Please revisit our Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda tutorials earlier in the Nanodegree program for installation instructions.
- The following packages (libraries) need to be installed.
    - Pandas
    - numpy
    - requests
    - tewwpy
    - matplotlib
    - json
    
- You need to be able to create written documents that contain images and you need to be able to export these documents as PDF files.

###  Project Steps 
1. Gathering Data
    - from three different source
2. Assessing Data
3. Cleaning Data
4. Storing and Acting on Wrangled Data
5. Visualizing and analyzing data
